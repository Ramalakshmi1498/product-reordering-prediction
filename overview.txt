Project Overview
Title: Deep Learning-Based Product Reordering Prediction

Objective: Predict whether a user will reorder a product based on their past purchase behavior using deep learning models.

Skills Acquired:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Building and training deep learning models

Classification and probability prediction

Evaluation with classification metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC)

Working with large tabular datasets

Model optimization and fine-tuning

Deployment-ready model preparation

Domain: E-Commerce / Retail / Customer Analytics

üß† Approach
1. Data Understanding and Exploration
Study product, order, aisle, and department datasets.

Join data appropriately to build a complete user-product interaction table.

2. Feature Engineering
User-based features: Average days between orders, total orders, etc.

Product-based features: Reorder ratio, number of times reordered, etc.

User-product interaction features: How many times user reordered the product.

3. Preprocessing
Handling missing data

Encoding categorical variables

Normalizing numerical features

4. Model Building
Train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier.

Try architectures like Feedforward Neural Networks or basic RNNs if needed.

5. Training and Validation
Split data into training and validation sets.

Use appropriate loss functions like Binary Cross-Entropy.

Monitor overfitting using EarlyStopping or similar techniques.

6. Evaluation
Evaluate using classification metrics (Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC).

7. Deployment Ready
Save the model and prepare prediction scripts.

üì• Dataset
The project uses the Instacart Market Basket Analysis dataset, containing:

orders.csv: Details about customer orders.

order_products_train.csv: Products associated with training orders (with reordered flags).

order_products_prior.csv: Products associated with prior orders.

products.csv: Product metadata.

aisles.csv: Aisle metadata.

departments.csv: Department metadata.

Data format: CSV

Variables include: user_id, product_id, order_id, aisle_id, department_id, reordered (0/1), order_dow, order_hour_of_day, days_since_prior_order, etc.

üß™ Preprocessing Steps
Merge datasets to create a full user-product interaction view.

Generate features like:

Number of times product ordered

Days since last order

User order frequency

Normalize and encode features for neural network input.
